## Aim: 
To make providers' USSD and phone MMI codes availble via phone app together with the normal contacts 
### Why:
With online banking and numerous other applications of cellular/mobile communication to:
- [x] make payments(mobile banking), 
- [x] register for events(tickets) etc.
- [x] some ussd are not free, i.e auto charge airtime just to access e.g kcb(banking) kiwasco(water utility) nssf(pension fund) and so on, if this number is dialed unintentionally then some amount is auto deducted, if same action was malicious then a big amount would be deducted
in terms of user experience and the interface,

1. the interface : {dial pad, char input field, keyboard(virtual on smartphones, physical on feature phones i.e the dial pad ),
2. the user : is subjected to memorise all this digits some shared so you would have \*xxx\*xx\*x\# (x is any number) just to access a service, this leads to a couple of issues:i. memory ii. missing a number
3. password field is not masked


Ps: some problems with sim applications e.g mPesa are design-centric based on the STK itself, and the stack/working of the SS7 protocol thus cannot be solved easily but that's why we hack each day! 

Happy hacking :+1: feel free to contribute :octocat: to this project.
